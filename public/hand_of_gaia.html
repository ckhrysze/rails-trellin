    <h5>Nature's Bounty</h5>
    <div>Vines and stuff. All abilities are considered supernatual unless otherwise noted.</div>
    <dl class="track">

    <dt>Circle 1 : Vinewrap</dt>
    <dd>As a standard action, you can wrap [Circle Rank] allies or enemies equal to within [Medium] range in vines for [Circle Rank] rounds. Enemies under this effect are [Entangled], while allies gain a Deflection bonus to their Armor Class equal to [Circle Rank]. If an ally moves more than 5 ft while under this effect, the effect dissipates. Enemies targeted by this ability can avoid the effect with a Reflex save (Circle DC). Enemies may attempt to free themselves from the effect with a Fortitude save (Circle DC - 5) as a move action. Vinewrap cannot affect flying creatures and is considered a [Binding] effect on enemies.</dd>

    <dt>Circle 2 : Vinepulse</dt>
    <dd>As a move action, once per round, you can cause your vines to pulse with energy. Allies effected by Vinewrap are healed for [Level] + your KOM, while enemies are subject to [Level] damage + your KOM. A successful Fortitude save (Circle DC) halves the damage dealt to enemies. You may also choose to pulse a single enemy or ally instead of all of them, which changes the healing or damage to [Level]d4 + your KOM.</dd>

    <dt>Circle 3 : ???</dt>
    <dd>You are now always under the effect of vinewrap. Additioanlly, select one of the two following abilites. This choice is permanent.
    <div>???: Once per [Encounter] when you use Vinepulse, you can remove all negative conditions effecting all allies under the effect of your Vinewrap.</div>
    <div>???: Vinepulse now also inflicts [Bleeding] to enemies that fail the Fortitude save.</div>
    </dd>
        
    <dt>Circle 4 : ???</dt>
    <dd>Vinewrap can now affect flying creatures and is no longer considered a [Binding] effect on enemies. Additionally, allies can now move any distance without Vinewrap dissipating. Vinepulse is also now usable as part of a move action.</dd>

    <dt>Circle 5 : ???</dt>
    <dd>Once per [Encounter] when you use Vinepulse, you can cause your vines to connect and rearrange anyone under the effect of Vinewrap. Swap the positioning of anyone under the effect of Vinewrap as long as they are an ally or they failed their Fortitude save.</dd>

    <dt>Circle 6 : ???</dt>
    <dd>Once per [Encounter], you may choose to have your Vinepulse deal [Level]d6 + your KOM as damage and healing instead of the normal [Level] + your KOM. Additionally, choose one of the two following abilities. This choice is permanent.
    <div>???: Allies affected by your Vinewrap no longer take any damage when making a successful Reflex saving throw against an an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save.</div>
    <div>???: Allies affected by your Vinewrap gain [Concealed].</div>

    <dt>Circle 7 : ???</dt>
    <dd>Once per [Round] as an immediate action, you can teleport a single ally or enemy under the effect of your Vinewrap 30 ft within line of site. Additionally, choose one of the two following abilites. This choice is permanent.
