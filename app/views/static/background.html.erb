<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The history section is much more 'in game', including important events as seen by the inhabitants of Trellin, and leaving out things that are 'obvious'. As such, this document is more targetting at providing the backround information any character in Trellin would just know.</p>

<p>There is just a single language used throughout Trellin, and its the same language used throughout Arisi. Trader's from Vesdyn have been known to speak at least two languages, but communication with them has largely been done with telepathy (there is a spell or two allowing for this). Coins are gold, silver and copper, each being worth ten of the next. The founders of Trellin wanted to place the ephasis on the land, and not the people, so the coins have the bells on one side, and the split egg shape on the other.</p>

<p>Vesdyn is much less fleshed out in my head right now...any won't become relevant for at least a little while, so will likely remain that way unless someone wants it for their backstory.</p>

<p>Trellin is ruled by a Triach (Monarchy whose head is a triumvirate, Phil and I made up the word). There is a council with some authority, though mostly just through prestige. The other major factor of the government are the bells, which were created to be an ideal voting system.</p>

<p>Trellin's major export is wine, and a major source of income is taxing imports. Since Trellin the standard of living in Trellin is higher than most of the countries it trades with, there are far more imports than exports.</p>
