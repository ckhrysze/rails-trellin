<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The history section is much more 'in game', including important events as seen by the inhabitants of Trellin, and leaving out things that are 'obvious'. As such, this document is more targetting at providing the backround information any character in Tlen would just know.</p>

<p>The (known) world, Usti, is a fairly typical high fantasy late medieval setting. Some places, Trellin included, are starting to see things like basic plumbing, boilers for hot water, etc; but typically only in the homes of the wealthy. However, magic is common enough that its presence is seen throughout the world, in one form or another; which in many cultures makes for a higher standard of living than was found in our world at the time.</p>

<p>Usti, as seen by a Trellian, consists of Arisi (the motherland), Trellin and Vesdyn. The island of Trellin sits in the middle of the Oskari ocean, is roughly egg shaped. It measures about 300 miles from east to west coast at its widest point, and about 1000 miles from north to south coast. The very wide, deep and slow Hiness river flows south from the remenents of the Jagand mountains, and splits nearly perfectly at Tlen, and continues to the east and west coasts.</p>

<p>Arisi, the motherland, makes the north-west border of the Oskari ocean. Just before Trellin's founders left, the country Duseak governed all of Arisi. Since Trellin's ecession and the Harredon invasion, Arisi broke apart into several countries. Most are only names to the Trellin people, except Ravuck, the last to be conquered by Dusaek. It is the most south eastern country, the closest to Trellin, and does the most direct trade with Trellin. It is understood that there is a land west of Arisi, beyond the original site of the Jagand mountains, but it is thought to be mostly barren tundra. There is also thought to be a lot of land south of Arisi, across the mighty Yesete river, but the rainforest to the immediate south was resistant to both physical and magical exploration.</p>

<p>In Trellin, much less is known about Vesdyn. First contact with Vesdyn happened less than 100 years ago, and despite not sharing a language, contact has thus far been peaceful. A few Trellian traders have been in the near port cities of It'enga and Zherothine, but not beyond.</p>

<p>Literacy, history, rudimentary biology and a basic understand of mathematics is prevelant in Trellin. All the cities have government funded schools, and the Hand's of Gaia (Nurtures and Geologists) traveling throughout the country provide this basic education to the rural populace. There is just a single language used throughout Trellin, and its the same language used throughout the motherland Arisi. Traders from Vesdyn have been known to speak at least two languages, but communication with them has largely been done with telepathy (there is a spell or two allowing for this). Coins are gold, silver and copper, each being worth ten of the next. The founders of Trellin wanted to place the ephasis on the land, and not the people, so the coins have the bells on one side, and the split egg shape on the other.</p>

<p>Trellin is ruled by a Triach (Monarchy whose head is a triumvirate, Phil and I made up the word). There is a council with some authority, though mostly just through prestige. The other major factor of the government are the bells, which were created to be an ideal voting system.</p>

<p>Trellin's major export is wine, and a major source of income is taxing imports. Since Trellin the standard of living in Trellin is higher than most of the countries it trades with, there are far more imports than exports.</p>

<p>The typical work week is four days long, with one day of rest. The 1st of every month is a holiday, with the larger celebrations occuring on the solstices and the equinoxs.</p>

<p>Trellin's major cities are Tlen, Radden and Eosi. The Tle'Core towers setup along the major thoroughfares also tend to have at least small communities, and a few are in something closer to cities.</p>
