<h2>Creation Guidelines</h2>

<h4>Mechanics</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Core reference can be found <a href="http://www.ruleofcool.com/get-the-game/">here.</a></li>
  <li>Character's will be basically moral (subject to personal definition, as long at it falls with 'acceptable' bounds).</li>
  <li>Character's will be legendary (has special meaning, last chapter of pdf.)</li>
  <li>Use the 16,14,14,12,10,10 stat rule.</li>
  <li>Full buy-in is allowed. I'll create/adapt guilds as needed to accommodate such, though player input on that front is encouraged.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Story</h4>
<p>I'm willing to work with each character regarding general status and placement within society; even potentially allowing characters that don't reside in Trellin. However, I'm choosing to eschew a cliched beginning like 'you meet in a bar' in favor of having each of you work up to why you are a part of the initial event.</p>

<p>The afore mentioned initial event is that the rulers of Trellin have asked for volunteers in investigating the disturbances coming from the Jagand mountains.</p>
