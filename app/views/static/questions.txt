Do the people of Trellin (or the world) have gods?  Holidays?  Is daily or weekly ceremony common?

What is the prevalent level of technology in Trellin, and the world?  Of magic?  Is literacy common?  What's the standard of living?

What are the most populous areas of Trellin?  Are they villages, towns, cities or metropolises (or something else)?  What about in other nations?

What's a typical Trellin meal?  Feast?  What do they drink?

What are Trellin's leisure activities?

Suppose the local authorities oust a criminal, and there is a fight in the process.  What do they fight with?  What are the authorities called?

Aside from civilian/royal government, the army and major religious groups, what factions exist on the island?  Are there guilds? societies? gangs? cults? secret police? superhero leagues?

Yes, it is almost exactly like talent trees.
They pdf is free to download; they have been working on supplemental content based on donations (to Child's Play, which is also cool).
I think they intend to make money by selling a monster manual at some point, and possibly pre-made campaigns.

9:20
phil.h.smith@gmail.com
Cool
PDFs are good, I read almost everything on my ipad these days

9:21
Christopher Hildebrand
This is perfect then 

9:21
phil.h.smith@gmail.com
Legend.pdf ?

9:21
Christopher Hildebrand
Yep

9:22
phil.h.smith@gmail.com
cool
Have any favorite (public knowledge) things about your setting ideas so far?

9:25
Christopher Hildebrand
Work in progress, but http://trellin.herokuapp.com/history

9:25
phil.h.smith@gmail.com
Oh, cool
haha
nice place holders

9:25
Christopher Hildebrand
The back story is way more fleshed out in my head, so feel free to ask questions.
Thank you 
Questions will help me focus anyway.

9:26
phil.h.smith@gmail.com
Right
(reading..)
I'm not that that far gone, the room is warded. ~ s/that that/that/
well

9:27
Christopher Hildebrand
Don and Donnie have both had a briefer version of the Trellin history; and it is intended to be public knowledge, as thats where people will start.
All, thank you

9:27
phil.h.smith@gmail.com
you asked for questions
Do you have an mspaint-grade map around?

9:28
Christopher Hildebrand
Sadly no…but Trellin is almost a perfect egg shape.

9:29
phil.h.smith@gmail.com
does the large end of the egg point towards a particular cardinal direction?

9:29
Christopher Hildebrand
Its a newish country, and since its was mostly man made via magic, hasn't had much time for natural changes.
Large end is south, though north of the equator.

9:31
phil.h.smith@gmail.com
What is the nation the settlers ceded from?

9:31
Christopher Hildebrand
North to south is roughly the distance between you and san diego; and the width at its widest is about the width of the widest horizontal in texas.

9:32
phil.h.smith@gmail.com
ok.  So about 400-600 mile diameter, it sounds like
hm
Are you going to be online for a while yet?  It's time for dinner for me
If not, I can just make a list of questions

9:33
Christopher Hildebrand
Not much longer, but…yeah, just email me some questions.

9:33
phil.h.smith@gmail.com
ok!
It looks cool!

9:33
Christopher Hildebrand
Thank you 

9:33
phil.h.smith@gmail.com
ok!  have fun, I'll catch you around later

9:33
Christopher Hildebrand
Sounds good, have a good evening!

How goes?

8:57
Christopher Hildebrand
Pretty good, yourself?

8:57
Phil Smith (gmail)
Not bad, getting ready to cook
but I have a few

8:58
Christopher Hildebrand
What are you making?

8:58
Phil Smith (gmail)
just some chicken and asparagus
mere's having polenta with it as well

8:58
Christopher Hildebrand
Were the questions you asked more to get me thinking, or were some specific you things you'd like to potentially build around?
Eww, asparagus.
No polenta for you?

8:58
Phil Smith (gmail)
oh right, I forgot your opinion of it
I'm trying to cut carbs for a bit

8:59
Christopher Hildebrand
Go tit
got it

8:59
Phil Smith (gmail)
A little of both, for the first question

8:59
Christopher Hildebrand
Thats one of the more amusing typos to commit.

8:59
Phil Smith (gmail)
I wasn't thinking of specific ideas yet, nor waiting for the answers to specific questions.
But you could see how my line of thinking could change if I was informed that, say, steampunk tech is running around
(don't infer that I want steampunk; it's just an example)

9:00
Christopher Hildebrand
Right, yeah. I'm using some of your questions as the basis for a background page; which is different from the history page by virtue of being out of character

9:01
Phil Smith (gmail)
Good call; that'd be awesome

9:01
Christopher Hildebrand
.Where as the history page is meant to be as written by a Trellin historian; and as such leaves out things that 'everyone just knows'.

9:01
Phil Smith (gmail)
right
I'm watching the screen, but my hands will be busy for the next 5-10

9:03
Christopher Hildebrand
Makes sense.

9:14
Phil Smith (gmail)
There we go

9:14
Christopher Hildebrand
Happily eating some chicken and brocilli?

9:15
Phil Smith (gmail)
nope
asparagus
and not quite, simmering
I suppose if I wanted a specific question answered sooner rather than later, it would be the urban vs rural one

9:20
Christopher Hildebrand
In Trellin itself, or the likely campaign areas?

9:20
Phil Smith (gmail)
What's the biggest settlement like, and are we going to be spending a lot of time there, or instead in the rural, or wild?
The second one, but both really
I can't really make a character idea that gels without first knowing what the trellin "everyman" is like, at least a little

9:21
Christopher Hildebrand
Trellin itself is fairly lightly populated, and the standard of living is very high for a roughly medivel culture.
Have you ever read the Rowan by Anne McKafry? (I'm sure I butchered her name...)

9:22
Phil Smith (gmail)
No, I don't think I've read any of her (and I know who you mean, the dragons of pern lady)
Should I just be thinking stock fantasy medival?

9:23
Christopher Hildebrand
Very high magic, but yes.

9:23
Phil Smith (gmail)
Waterwheels, no boilers
Mostly agricultural, maybe a merchant class

9:24
Christopher Hildebrand
Maybe primative boilers, certainly not powering anything but rudimentary plumbing in the houses of the richest.
Merchant class is a definite.
So, the Rowan series is sci-fi, and the gist is that there are telepaths, Earth is way over crowded, and space proposion is lacking.
However, a certain kind of engine provides something that the telepaths can pull from, and combined can shuttle spacecraft very large distances basically instantly.

9:26
Phil Smith (gmail)
reminds me strongly of the guild in dune

9:27
Christopher Hildebrand
Less politics involved, but in core function, that sounds right.
Trellin has that…I got the idea from one of the supplements rule of cool has released.

9:28
Phil Smith (gmail)
groovy
should I call them telepaths, or is there another name?

9:28
Christopher Hildebrand
Its just a series of 4 feats, but the final one allows for transporting up to 6000 pounds.

9:28
Phil Smith (gmail)
Also, that suggests they read minds, which is not what you said

9:28
Christopher Hildebrand
Telepaths is fine, Tle'Core is the guild name.

9:28
Phil Smith (gmail)
they're organized into a guild? ok

9:29
Christopher Hildebrand
Te ones in the books can, mine can't
At least, it isn't implied by the other…I don't recall there being and mind reading spells; and I'm not inclined to invent them if there aren't.

9:29
Phil Smith (gmail)
works for me

9:29
Christopher Hildebrand
The other catch is that you can't move living things.

9:30
Phil Smith (gmail)
ok
Is this the main magical feature of the setting?
Is it common?

9:30
Christopher Hildebrand
But, it does make transporting anything else a breeze.

9:30
Phil Smith (gmail)
Do farmers pull their carts with it?

9:31
Christopher Hildebrand
It is very common in Trellin, and known in the land they left because of that, but it isn't at all common in the rest of the world.
Farmers wouldn't pull their cart with it, but they would leave there cart in pull stations, and have the guild move it where it needed to go.
their

9:32
Phil Smith (gmail)
Ok.  I should treat it like an acquired discipline, rather than an innate ability
Children don't do this; but people (or special people) can after lengthy training

9:32
Christopher Hildebrand
Right, players are certainly welcome to take this feats, which implies association with the guild. I haven't decided on how strongly this is enforced yet.
But moving more than a 1lb or two implies level 3 or above, and DnDish games work out to have very few people really above 1 or 2.
Or so its always seemed to me.

9:34
Phil Smith (gmail)
Ok
Is casual use strictly controlled?
Perhaps everyone does it a little, guildies do it a lot
("everybody" meaning I, or probably someone I know, does)

9:35
Christopher Hildebrand
That said, I never really knew how specialists should work…so there will almost definitely be people who can move more mass than that, but can't, say, attack with a level 8 base attack bonus.
Yeah…I think moving small household objects around would be common enough that not everyone has it, but everyone knows someone that does.

9:35
Phil Smith (gmail)
gotcha
how long ago was the island created & settled?
closer to decades, or centuries?

9:36
Christopher Hildebrand
That will eventually be in the history, but a few centuries.
However, the reason they left is the ruler was a necromancer, which while not strictly forbidden then, was largely discouraged.

9:37
Phil Smith (gmail)
Should I infer the tyrant is still around?
perhaps that's unknown

9:38
Christopher Hildebrand
Its unknown, but when the troubles that start the campaign start, its immediately rumored.

9:38
Phil Smith (gmail)
fair enough
Is trellin a monarchy?
or even before that, do you see the campaign taking a political slant?

9:39
Christopher Hildebrand
Limited, and the monarch is a triumvirate. (Does that get its own name?)

9:39
Phil Smith (gmail)
it does
..or I guess it's just comonarch
which sounds stupid.  How about triarch?

9:39
Christopher Hildebrand
Sounds better than comonach, thats for sure.

9:40
Phil Smith (gmail)
ok, there are 3 of them; cool

9:40
Christopher Hildebrand
They are elected…ish.
So, the notes for the bells of truth (which is a terribly corney name…).
The gist is that they are an attempt for the perfect voting system.
Each citizen that chooses to vote goes to the nearest bell (one per city of…some size), and the bells 'knows' how the person votes.

9:42
Phil Smith (gmail)
hm!
That's novel
magic bell then?

9:42
Christopher Hildebrand
Similiar-ish to the sorting hat, I suppose.
Yes, definitely magic.

9:42
Phil Smith (gmail)
cool

9:43
Christopher Hildebrand
Basic hereditary lines are followed for the next ruler (each of whom rule for life), but the people get to vote on the heir either when they need to take the thrown, or their 30th birthday.

9:44
Phil Smith (gmail)
A choice between siblings then?

9:44
Christopher Hildebrand
Oldest wins, though gender doesn't matter.

9:44
Phil Smith (gmail)
if oldest wins, what do the bell votes do?

9:45
Christopher Hildebrand
Sorry, the vote is basically 'yes or no, the heir will make a worthy ruler'.
Only once was the heir voted against, and this happened recently enough that most people remember it.

9:46
Phil Smith (gmail)
When the poll says no, the eldest doesn't assume the throne?

9:46
Christopher Hildebrand
Correct

9:46
Phil Smith (gmail)
ok; it goes to the next in line, I suppose?  Or is that also voted on?

9:47
Christopher Hildebrand
The next oldest sibling in then heir, but then also faces a vote when they turn 30 (or the monarch dies).

9:47
Phil Smith (gmail)
ah, gotcha
cool, I like it

9:48
Christopher Hildebrand
Its also possible for an heir step down; by virture of having a vote of one by themsevels…I worded that poorly.

9:49
Phil Smith (gmail)
The heir might voluntarily bow out, by casting a vote against him/herself?

9:50
Christopher Hildebrand
Right, and maybe they are the first to vote…yea, I'll stick with that.

9:50
Phil Smith (gmail)
works for me
How many other relevant countries do you expect?
The motherland, probably.  Others?

9:51
Christopher Hildebrand
This was briefly mentioned in the dialog, but the reason the motherland didn't come for Trellin immediately was that the mountains were more or less keeping an invasion force out.

9:52
Phil Smith (gmail)
ah.  The names got in the way, I didn't know what was meant
Aren't those mountains now gone?

9:52
Christopher Hildebrand
Right, I cleaned it up a little, and will post it before I go to bed.
Right, the mountains are now in the middle of the ocean, and were used to make the little island of trellin into the size I gave you last night.

9:54
Phil Smith (gmail)
and that was some odd 300-400 years ago

9:54
Christopher Hildebrand
The motherland was no open for invasion, which was the predominant reason Nec'Laram didn't come for the settlers.

9:54
Phil Smith (gmail)
or perhaps over the span of 300-400 years

9:54
Christopher Hildebrand
no = now

9:54
Phil Smith (gmail)
ah
The mountains were protecting them, not keeping them out
ok

9:55
Christopher Hildebrand
Right, ok…I think everyone who read that was confused on that point, which clearly means its in my wording.

9:55
Phil Smith (gmail)
srry
Aside from forcing the motherland's attention, do you expect the would-be invading country enter into things?

9:56
Christopher Hildebrand
I'm not sure yet, although at least a little, I think.

9:56
Phil Smith (gmail)
Do I expect to meet one on the street?

9:56
Christopher Hildebrand
No

9:56
Phil Smith (gmail)
ok

9:57
Christopher Hildebrand
They have no presence in Trellin, and little in the port towns Trellin might trade with on Arisi (the motherland's continent).

9:57
Phil Smith (gmail)
gotcha
How much friction is there between trellans and whatever the motherlanders are called?
Are they considered dangerous aliens, common folk like me, or untrusted strangers?

10:01
Christopher Hildebrand
So, Arisi was conquered by Nec'Laram's father, and as soon as the invasion by the Harredon (other side of the mountain) began, that empire disolved back into seperate countries. Most are pretty grateful for that.
Also, its not quite common knowledge, but at least well known in trade and academic circles, that the Harredon didn't actually invade per se, they basically just destroyed anything having anything to do with necromancy.

10:04
Phil Smith (gmail)
so..  I, joe public trellan, am mistrustful of people from Nec'Laram's country?  But we're not at open war?
I'm not asking for my character's personal beliefs, understand.  I want to see what the "attitude of the town" is like

10:07
Christopher Hildebrand
RIght…I don't think there is an general attitude, really. I think if you lived in the port towns on that side of Trellin; you wouldn't have any particular distrust beyond most people's general distrust of foreingers.
Same with the capital, who would have seen ambadadors and such.

10:08
Phil Smith (gmail)
Ok
So the people in the know believe we're in a stable peace

10:08
Christopher Hildebrand
Country folk and those on the other side perhaps more so, but more from a 'unknown thing' standpoint that anything to do with history.
Right

10:08
Phil Smith (gmail)
If there was some whatnot with a falling empire a few decades ago, it's all done now, or anyway it's too far away to care
(again, speaking as an average trellan citizen might)

10:09
Christopher Hildebrand
Yeah, especially since its a century or two.

10:09
Phil Smith (gmail)
ah, ok
You mentioned academic circles.  My list of social classes looks something like farmer/herder/serf, merchant, aristocrat, and now maybe scholar.
Toss on sailor
and maybe clergy?

10:12
Christopher Hildebrand
I haven't decided yet on clergy.

10:12
Phil Smith (gmail)
oh, and telekinetic guildies
and/or other wizard power

10:13
Christopher Hildebrand
It isn't needed for the mechanics…but I plan to have a strong nature god/diety presence, though perhaps not active except through followers.

10:13
Phil Smith (gmail)
Cool, sounds good

10:13
Christopher Hildebrand
Another aspect of the high quality of life is the magic that allowed the terraforming in the first place…that magic plus slightly longer than our year year yields two harvests per year.

10:14
Phil Smith (gmail)
nice
10:14
that's simple, but novel
how many suns and moons are there?

10:15
Christopher Hildebrand
One sun, two moons
I need to save this conversation, because there was enough things I made up on the spot… 

10:15
Phil Smith (gmail)
sure thing, I thought there might be a little
